# 🧰 How to Install Node.js

## ✅ Step 1: Go to the Official Website

👉 Visit: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

You’ll see two versions:

- **LTS (Long-Term Support)** – ✅ Recommended for most users
- **Current** – 🚀 Latest features, but may be less stable

👉 **Choose the LTS version** unless you have a specific reason to go with Current.

## 🖥️ Step 2: Download & Install

Click the **LTS download** button for your system:

- 🪟 **Windows**
- 🍎 **macOS**
- 🐧 **Linux** (see instructions below)

Then:

1. Run the installer.
2. Follow the installation wizard.
3. Make sure the box that says **“Add to PATH”** is checked (it’s selected by default).
4. Complete the setup.

## 🧪 Step 3: Verify Installation

After installation, open your **terminal or command prompt** and run:

**node -v**

_If you are able to see the node version , that means it has been successfully installed in your system_

Then check Node Package Manager by running the command : 

**npm -v**

You should see the npm version too — it comes bundled with Node.js.
