# 🧠 What is Node.js?

**Node.js** is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code **outside of a web browser** — like on your computer or a server.

Usually, JavaScript runs only in the browser (like Chrome or Firefox), but Node.js lets you run JavaScript on the **backend**, just like other languages such as **Python**, **Java**, or **PHP**.

## 🛠️ What is Node.js Used For?

Node.js is used to build **server-side applications and tools**. Here are some common use cases:

### 1. 🌐 Web Servers & APIs

Build web servers that handle requests, send data, or serve websites.  
**Example:** A backend API that sends user data to a website.

### 2. 💬 Real-Time Apps

Ideal for chat apps, online games, or live notifications.  
**Example:** WhatsApp-like apps, or multiplayer games.

### 3. 📁 File Operations & Automation

Read/write files, manage systems, or create build tools.  
**Example:** A script that renames all files in a folder.

### 4. 📦 Command Line Tools

Many developer tools (like `npm`) are built using Node.js.  
**Example:** Creating a tool that automatically compresses images.
