# 🖥️ CLI vs. GUI – What’s the Difference?

## ✅ CLI (Command Line Interface)

**What it is:**  
A text-based interface where you type commands to tell the computer what to do.

**Looks like:**  
A black screen with white text (like a terminal or command prompt).

**Example:**  
You type `cd foldername` to move into a folder.

**Pros:**
- ⚡ Fast once you know the commands
- 🧠 Uses very little computer memory
- 🤖 Great for automation and advanced users

**Cons:**
- ❗ Hard for beginners (you need to remember commands)
- 🚫 Not very visual

## 🖱️ GUI (Graphical User Interface)

**What it is:**  
A visual interface where you use your mouse to click on buttons, icons, and menus.

**Looks like:**  
What you see on Windows, macOS, or most mobile apps.

**Example:**  
You double-click a folder to open it.

**Pros:**
- 🧒 Easy to learn and use
- 💡 More intuitive for beginners
- 👁️ Shows information in a clear, visual way

**Cons:**
- 🐢 Can be slower for complex tasks
- 🧵 Uses more memory and resources

## 🎯 Summary

CLI is like giving instructions by typing — powerful but needs practice.  
GUI is like using a smartphone — easy and visual, but not as flexible for power users.

**Both have their place.**  
Developers often prefer CLI for speed and automation, while most users prefer GUI for ease of use and visual clarity.
