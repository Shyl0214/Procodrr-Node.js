## What is an ArrayBuffer?

An **ArrayBuffer** is a **fixed-length container for raw binary data**.

- Think of it as a chunk of memory that stores bytes (0s and 1s)
- It does **not** store numbers, strings, or objects directly ‚Äî just the raw binary form
- Once created, the size of an ArrayBuffer cannot be changed

### Simple Analogy
Imagine an ArrayBuffer as a storage box with numbered compartments, where each compartment can hold exactly one byte of data. You can't directly see what's inside without using special tools to interpret the contents.

## Why Do We Use ArrayBuffers?

We need ArrayBuffers when working with **low-level binary operations** such as:

- Reading files in binary form
- Handling image, audio, or video data
- Working with network protocols that send/receive raw bytes
- Sharing memory between threads or WebAssembly modules

## Why Are They Important?

### üöÄ **Efficient Storage**
Stores data in a compact binary format, minimizing memory usage.

### üåê **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
Works in both browsers and Node.js, unlike Node's `Buffer` which is Node-only.

### ‚ö° **Performance**
Faster for reading/writing binary data than using strings or objects.

### üèóÔ∏è **Foundation for Binary Handling**
`TypedArray` and `DataView` work on top of ArrayBuffers to actually interpret the data.

## Common Use Cases

### üìÅ **File Processing**
- Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF)
- Videos (MP4, AVI, MOV)
- Documents (PDFs, Word files)

### üì° **Data Streaming**
- Audio/video playback
- Live feeds and real-time data
- Media streaming applications

### üåê **Networking**
- Binary protocols
- WebSocket messages
- Custom network communication

### üîß **WebAssembly Integration**
- Interfacing with WebAssembly modules
- High-performance computing applications

### üéÆ **Game Development**
- Textures and sprites
- 3D models and meshes
- Game asset management

## Key Takeaways

> üì¶ **ArrayBuffer = raw storage box for binary data**
> 
> üõ†Ô∏è To actually read/write it, we'll use `TypedArray` or `DataView`

### Important Notes:
- ArrayBuffers store raw binary data only
- They have a fixed size that cannot be changed after creation
- You cannot directly manipulate the data without using views (`TypedArray` or `DataView`)
- They provide a foundation for efficient binary data operations

## What's Next?

In the next topic, we'll explore:
- **TypedArray**: How to read and write specific data types (integers, floats, etc.)
- **DataView**: How to handle mixed data types and control byte order
- **Practical examples**: Real-world usage patterns and code samples

## Quick Reference

```javascript
// Creating an ArrayBuffer
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16); // 16 bytes

// Check the size
console.log(buffer.byteLength); // 16

// Note: You cannot directly access the data!
// You need TypedArray or DataView to work with it
```
