## 📝 Creating Files & Folders

### 📄 `touch` – Create a New File

```bash
touch file.txt
```

Creates a blank file named `file.txt` in the current directory.

👉 **You can also create multiple files at once:**

```bash
touch a.txt b.txt c.txt
```

### 📂 `mkdir` – Create a New Folder

```bash
mkdir myFolder
```

Creates a folder named `myFolder`.

👉 **Create multiple folders:**

```bash
mkdir folder1 folder2
```

👉 **Create nested folders:**

```bash
mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild
```

## 📋 Copying Files & Folders

### 📁 `cp` – Copy Files

```bash
cp file1.txt file2.txt
```

Copies `file1.txt` to a new file called `file2.txt`.

👉 **Copy into a folder:**

```bash
cp file1.txt myFolder/
```

👉 **Copy entire folder (with `-r` for recursive):**

```bash
cp -r folder1 folder2
```

## 🚚 Moving or Renaming

### ✏️ `mv` – Move or Rename Files/Folders

- **Rename a file:**
  ```bash
  mv oldname.txt newname.txt
  ```

- **Move file to another folder:**
  ```bash
  mv file.txt folder/
  ```

- **Rename/move folder:**
  ```bash
  mv oldFolder newFolder
  ```

## ❌ Deleting Files & Folders

### 🗑️ `rm` – Remove Files

```bash
rm file.txt
```

Deletes the file permanently.

### 🗑️ `rm -r` – Remove Folders (Recursively)

```bash
rm -r foldername
```

Deletes a folder and **everything inside** it.

### 🛑 `rm -f` – Force Delete a File

```bash
rm -f file.txt
```

Deletes a file **without asking for confirmation** (use carefully).

### 🚫 `rm -rf` – Force Delete Folder and Contents

```bash
rm -rf foldername
```

- `-r`: recursive (go inside folders)
- `-f`: force (no confirmation)

⚠️ **Dangerous if misused**. There's no undo!

### 🧼 `rmdir` – Remove Empty Folder Only

```bash
rmdir emptyfolder
```

Only works if the folder is **completely empty**.

## 📌 Quick Command Reference Table

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `touch` | Create a file |
| `mkdir` | Create a folder |
| `cp` | Copy files/folders |
| `mv` | Move or rename |
| `rm` | Delete a file |
| `rm -r` | Delete folder & contents |
| `rm -f` | Force delete file (no confirmation) |
| `rm -rf` | Force delete folder & contents |
| `rmdir` | Delete empty folder |

## ⚠️ Safety Tips

### ✅ Pro Tip:
Always double-check the path when using `rm`, especially with `-rf`, to avoid deleting important files.

### 🛡️ Best Practices:

1. **Use `ls` before `rm`** to see what you're about to delete
2. **Be extra careful with `-rf`** - it's irreversible
3. **Use absolute paths** when possible to avoid confusion
4. **Test commands on dummy files** first if you're unsure
5. **Consider using `mv` to a trash folder** instead of `rm` for important files

## 🧪 Practice Examples

### Create a Practice Environment

```bash
# Create a test directory
mkdir practice_terminal
cd practice_terminal

# Create some files and folders
touch test1.txt test2.txt
mkdir documents images
mkdir -p projects/web/css

# List everything
ls -la
```

### Copy Operations

```bash
# Copy a file
cp test1.txt test1_backup.txt

# Copy file to a folder
cp test2.txt documents/

# Copy entire folder
cp -r documents documents_backup
```

### Move and Rename Operations

```bash
# Rename a file
mv test1.txt renamed_test.txt

# Move file to folder
mv test2.txt images/

# Rename folder
mv images media
```

### Delete Operations

```bash
# Delete a single file
rm test1_backup.txt

# Delete an empty folder
rmdir projects/web/css

# Delete folder with contents (be careful!)
rm -r documents_backup
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem**: `mkdir: cannot create directory 'folder': File exists`
**Solution**: The folder already exists. Use `ls` to check, or use a different name.

**Problem**: `rm: cannot remove 'folder': Is a directory`
**Solution**: Use `rm -r folder` instead of `rm folder` for directories.

**Problem**: `rmdir: failed to remove 'folder': Directory not empty`
**Solution**: Either delete contents first, or use `rm -r folder` to delete everything.

**Problem**: `cp: omitting directory 'folder'`
**Solution**: Use `cp -r source_folder destination_folder` for directories.

**Problem**: Permission denied errors
**Solution**: Check file permissions or use `sudo` (with extreme caution).

## 🚀 Next Steps

After mastering these commands, explore:

- **File permissions**: `chmod`, `chown`
- **File content**: `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`
- **Text editing**: `nano`, `vim`
- **File searching**: `find`, `grep`
- **Archive operations**: `tar`, `zip`

## 🆘 Emergency Commands

If you accidentally delete something important:

1. **Stop using the system immediately**
2. Look into file recovery tools like `testdisk` or `photorec`
3. Check if you have backups
4. Consider professional data recovery services for critical data

**Remember**: Terminal commands are powerful but permanent. Practice with test files first, and always double-check your commands before pressing Enter!
