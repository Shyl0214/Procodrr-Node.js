## 📘 What is a Terminal?

A **terminal** (also called command line or shell) is a **text-based interface** that lets you **interact with your computer using commands**.

Instead of clicking icons, you **type instructions**, giving you **more control and flexibility** — especially useful for developers, system admins, and power users.

## 💻 Popular Terminals

- **macOS Terminal**
- **Linux Terminal** 
- **Windows Terminal** or Command Prompt (with Git Bash or WSL for Unix-like experience)

## 🧪 Basic Commands in the Terminal

### 🔤 `echo` – Print Text in the Terminal

The `echo` command **prints text or variables** to the screen.

```bash
echo Hello, World!
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

#### 👤 Printing Your Name

```bash
echo "My name is Shailesh"
```

#### ➕ Doing Math Operations with `echo` (using `$(( ))`)

```bash
echo $((5 + 3))
```

**Output:**
```
8
```

You can use any basic math: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`

### 📂 `pwd` – Print Working Directory

Shows the **full path of your current location** in the system.

```bash
pwd
```

Example output:
```
/home/user/Documents
```

### 📁 `cd` – Change Directory

Use `cd` to move between folders.

- **Move into a folder:**
  ```bash
  cd foldername
  ```

- **Move one level back:**
  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```

- **Go to home directory:**
  ```bash
  cd ~
  ```

### 📄 `ls` – List Files and Folders

Shows the **contents of the current directory**.

```bash
ls
```

- **Show all hidden files too:**
  ```bash
  ls -a
  ```

- **Show detailed list:**
  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```

## 🔗 What Are Symbolic Links?

A **symbolic link** (or **symlink**) is like a **shortcut** to another file or folder.

Think of it as a **pointer** that redirects you to the original file.

### 🧰 Example:

```bash
ln -s original.txt shortcut.txt
```

This creates a **shortcut named** `shortcut.txt` that points to `original.txt`.

- Editing or opening `shortcut.txt` affects `original.txt`
- Useful for organizing files, managing large projects, or reusing configs

## 🧠 Command Summary

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `echo` | Print text or do math |
| `pwd` | Show current directory path |
| `cd` | Change directory |
| `ls` | List files/folders in current directory |
| `ln -s` | Create symbolic (soft) links |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Open your terminal:**
   - **macOS:** Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal"
   - **Windows:** Search for "Command Prompt" or install Git Bash
   - **Linux:** Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

2. **Try the basic commands:**
   ```bash
   # Check where you are
   pwd
   
   # List what's in current directory
   ls
   
   # Print a message
   echo "Hello Terminal!"
   
   # Do some math
   echo $((10 + 5))
   ```

3. **Practice navigation:**
   ```bash
   # Go to home directory
   cd ~
   
   # List all files (including hidden)
   ls -a
   
   # Go back one directory
   cd ..
   ```

## 📈 Next Steps

After mastering these basics, you can explore:

- File manipulation commands (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`)
- Text editing in terminal (`nano`, `vim`)
- File permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
- Process management (`ps`, `kill`)
- Package management (`npm`, `pip`, `apt`)
